# Overview
Get string you want given multiple strings or character.   
There are two works in this repos..  

First, given multiple strings, output string generated by merging them alternately.  
e.g. Input: [abc,123], Output: [a1b2c3]  

Second, given one string and one character, output string generated by inserting that character after each charater in string.  
e.g. Input: [abc,1], Output: [a1b1c]  

Called alternate and insert later.  

All explanations and comments in Japanese.
